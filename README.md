# Summoners 

Our ambition is to create a social platform for League of Legends players, so they can communicate their thoughts, chat or share highlights of their games.

*Summoners* is the collective work of team IKEA, a team formed at \</salt> 's FullStack Development bootcamp. The project was created during the last two weeks of July and serves as an MVP.

IKEA builders:
* Andre Amado (https://github.com/andreamadoo)
* Yadish Bukhari (https://github.com/syed-yadish)
* Kostas Chaniotakis (https://github.com/JuniorWells)
* Erik Hainer (https://github.com/ErikHainer)

TechStack we used:
* Front End: ReactJS
* Back End: .NET webApi + Entity Framework
* DB: SQL server (docker container)

In its current state, our product gives the user the opportunity:
1. To look for their co-players by Summoner Name and see how they are doing in the game
2. To create posts on their profile
3. To comment on other players' posts

Further Iterations:
1. User Authentication
2. Chat
3. Uploading Videos

We use the official Riot API, thus we applied for a permanent key. That will allow us to deploy our app and use RIOT's authentication to log in.

Below you can find a video presentation of the above mentioned and take a look at our app!
